# Decamber
(yeah it's a bad name it'll have to do for now)

SCDF does these cost recovery procedure where they create powerpoint slides
and paste in photos taken from their phones for false alarm decams.

## What are decams
It's when fire alarm systems in a building sound off for too long and SCDF will
be automatically alerted and dispatched to investigate.
