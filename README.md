# Decamber
SCDF does these cost recovery procedure where they create powerpoint slides
and paste in photos taken from their phones for false alarm decams. They also add in other details
that provide context to the case they attended

## What are decams
It's when fire alarm systems in a building sound off for too long and SCDF will
be automatically alerted and dispatched to investigate.
